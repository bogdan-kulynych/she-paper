\maketitle\thispagestyle{empty}

We describe a symmetric variant of homomomorphic encryption scheme by van Dijk et al.~\cite{DGHV10}, that remains semantically secure under the (error-free) approximate-GCD problem. The scheme allows to perform mixed homomorphic operations on ciphertexts and plaintexts, eliminating the need to encrypt new ciphertexts using the public key in a remote execution setting for some algorithms. Compared to the original scheme, the properties of our variant enable for smaller communication cost for generic secure function evaluation applications, specifically, private information retrieval.
